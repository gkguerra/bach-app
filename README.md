# Bachelor Nation: Fantasy Football

## A reality TV fantasy football application!

*The Bachelorette is a reality tv dating show in which 25 eligible male bachelors compete to find love with a chosen 
bachelorette. Each week, the bachelorette goes on dates with the bachelors and eliminates those she does not have a 
connection with through a rose ceremony. Men progressing to the next week of the show get a rose, men who do not get a rose are sent home. This 
continues until two men remain, and the bachelorette accepts a marriage proposal from one of them. There is romance,
drama, love, and lots of laughs!*

**What will the application do?**
- This application will track the statistics of each bachelor as they compete for love (number of dates, 
number of roses received, etc.)
- This application will show a leaderboard of the front runner bachelors. 
- This application will allow users to create a "team" of bachelors and they can check on their team throughout 
the season.

**Who will use it?**
- The viewers of the Bachelor/Bachelorette (also known as Bachelor Nation). For reference 6.07 million people watched
the Bachelor finale in 2021.

**Why is this project of interest to you?**
- My guilty pleasure is watching the Bachelor/Bachelorette! I figure I should put my knowledge of the show to good use 
in developing this application.
- I think other viewers of the Bachelor/Bachelorette might actually use this application!
